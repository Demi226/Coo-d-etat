what to still do:
	1) in every file where a value is needed (simple ctrl f): 
		BalanceVariables.dictionaryName["name"]

	2) make MainMenu scene the start scene in build
	3) after build set, change the MainMenu(gameobject) StartScene value

	4) on player death/ level clear, call gamemanager startbalance or setup gamemanager ondeath
	5) on enemy spawn, set seen to true for that enemy (needed for boss, enemy types
		ex: when spawn do BalanceVariables.seenDictionaries["droneEnemy"] = true;

	6) make a terminal for shop doing what is shown in the scene Shop under the canvas called SHowingOpenShop's button called OpenShop
	7) add other enemy types and other values to the BalanceVariables.cs (simple copy paste and change dictionary name)

	8) in BalanceMenu.cs line 85 call database saving (unless we want to do it on close)
	9) in MainMenu.cs start function, update base balancevariables from the database by replacing the dictionaries



Enemy/boss files:
	in start:
		set variables to BalanceVariables: ex maxHealth = BalanceVariables.droneBoss["maxHealth"];
		add seen as true: BalanceVariables.seenDictionaries["droneBoss"] = true;

player:
	in start:
		set variables to BalanceVariables: ex maxHealth = BalanceVariables.player["maxHealth"];
	in TakeDamage:
		add to death:
		GameManager.Instance.OnPlayerDeath();
